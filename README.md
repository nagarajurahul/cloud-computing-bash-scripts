IT interests

My uncle introduced me to Google Search at age 7 (probably in 2006), for an assignment on Giraffes. Intrigued by it's capability, I played around tech devices thereafter.
Earned a B.Tech Degree in Electronics and Computers. Joined IBM for it's innovative Cloud Project and enjoyed cutting edge technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins and other automation and Cloud tools. 
Wanted to get more exposure to technology and meet new people, hence Master's in ITM at Illinois Tech.
Looking to contribute, innovate new ideas and help the society through IT.
