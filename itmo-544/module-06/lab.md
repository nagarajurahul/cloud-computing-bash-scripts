## Assumptions

Assume all the requirements from module-05 to be completed and this module's requirements will add on to module-05. You will need to add additional IAM permissions for Secrets Manager and RDS.

## Part 1

Add to your `create-env.sh` a commands to create a [proper RDS instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateDBInstance.html "RDS how to create with passwords managed page"), along with a `db-subnet-group`. Use the `--manage-master-user-password` option to allow the AWS Secrets Manager to handle your password. ~~Add a read-replica to this option.~~ Use `--db-instance-identifier` for `${19}` and use `db.t3.micro` as the free-tier db instance type. Tag your database with the module tag. Though it will take extra time, make use of waiters for the RDS instances.

## Part 2

Modify your `destroy-env.sh` to detach and destroy all resources launched during the `create-env.sh` process. Watch the waiter logic. Note that destroying a database takes 5-15 minutes. Plan accordingly. Though it will take extra time, make use of waiters for the RDS instances.

## Part 3

Using the [Python Boto3 AWS SDK](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html "Python Boto3 AWS SDK") you will write an autograder script for this project. One for the `create-env.sh` named: `create-env-grader.py`, and one for the `destroy-env.py` named: `destroy-env-grader.py`. Print out information per item below to the screen and keep a grandtotal to print out your score out of 5.

For the `create-env-grader.py`:

* Check for the existence of ~~two~~ one RDS instances
* Check for the existence of the **module-06** tag for the database instance~~s~~
* Check for the existence of one Secret in your Secrets Manager
* Check for the existence of three EC2 instances tagged: **module-06**
* Check for the ELB to return an HTTP 200 upon request

For the `destroy-env-grader.py`:

* Check for the existence of zero Launch Templates
* Check for the existence of zero Autoscaling Groups
* Check for the existence of zero ELBs
* Check for the existence of zero EC2 instances
* Check for the existence of zero RDS instances

## Deliverables

Create a folder named: `module-06` under your class folder in the provided private repo. Provide the following files:

* `create-env.sh`
* `destroy-env.sh`
* `create-env-test.py`
* `destroy-env-test.py`
  * I will test this script by using my own account information

Submit the URL to the `module-06` folder to Canvas.
